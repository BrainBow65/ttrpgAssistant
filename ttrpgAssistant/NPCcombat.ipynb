    "According to the book in your browser, the steps involved in a combat encounter are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initiative**: The Gatemaster determines the order of turns by asking each combatant to make an initiative check. This is a d20 roll plus the combatant's Dexterity or Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher. The combatant with the highest result goes first, followed by the second-highest, and so on. If two or more combatants have the same result, the Gatemaster decides the order among them.\n",
    "- **Turns**: Each combatant takes one turn per round. On their turn, a combatant can perform one action, one bonus action, and one reaction. They can also move up to their speed, which is usually 6 meters. Some actions, bonus actions, and reactions are defined by the combatant's class, race, or equipment, while others are common to all combatants, such as attacking, dodging, or using an item. The Gatemaster may also allow other actions that are appropriate to the situation, such as breaking down a door, climbing a wall, or persuading an enemy to surrender.\n",
    "- **Damage and Healing**: When a combatant makes an attack, they roll a d20 and add their attack bonus¹[1]. The Gatemaster compares this total against the target's Armor Class (AC) to determine if the attack hits²[2]. If the attack hits, the combatant rolls damage dice and adds their damage bonus. The target reduces their hit points (HP) by the amount of damage dealt. If a combatant's HP reaches 0, they fall unconscious and may die unless they receive healing or stabilization³[3]. Healing can be done by certain class abilities, items, or procedures. Stabilization can be done by making a successful DC 10 Medicine check or using a medkit on an unconscious combatant.\n",
    "- **Conditions and Ailments**: Some attacks or effects may cause a combatant to suffer a condition or an ailment. A condition is a temporary state that affects a combatant's capabilities, such as being blinded, restrained, or stunned. An ailment is a lasting affliction that requires treatment, such as being poisoned, diseased, or irradiated. Each condition and ailment has its own rules for how it affects a combatant and how it can be removed.\n",
    "- **Ending the Encounter**: The combat encounter ends when one side is defeated, surrenders, flees, or negotiates a truce. The Gatemaster decides the outcome and consequences of the encounter, such as awarding mission points, loot, or information to the player characters. The Gatemaster may also allow the player characters to take a short or long rest after the encounter to recover some of their resources.\n",

    "Here is a step by step guide on how a Gatemaster could design a combat encounter including mounted or pilot combat, based on the book in your browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Choose the **plot mechanics** for the encounter, such as the **objective**, the **complication**, the **twist**, and the **resolution**. These are the elements that make the encounter interesting and meaningful for the story. For example, the objective could be to escape from a Jaffa patrol, the complication could be that the Stargate is guarded, the twist could be that an ally betrays the team, and the resolution could be that the team manages to dial out with the help of a local resistance group.\n",
    "- Step 2: Choose the **action mechanics** for the encounter, such as the **environment**, the **enemies**, the **allies**, and the **special rules**. These are the elements that make the encounter challenging and dynamic for the gameplay. For example, the environment could be a forested planet with rough terrain, the enemies could be a squad of Jaffa on gliders, the allies could be a group of rebels on motorcycles, and the special rules could be that the team can use their vehicles to perform maneuvers, attacks, or stunts.\n",
    "- Step 3: Determine the **difficulty** of the encounter, based on the **tension die** and the **level** of the player characters. The difficulty affects the **number** and **strength** of the enemies, the **damage** and **health** of the vehicles, and the **DC** of the checks and saves. For example, if the tension die is 1d6 and the player characters are level 3, the encounter could have 6 Jaffa on gliders (each with AC 14, HP 15, and a staff weapon that deals 1d6+1d6 damage), and 4 rebels on motorcycles (each with AC 12, HP 10, and a zat gun that deals 1d4+1d4 damage). The vehicles could have AC 10, HP 20, and a speed of 60 meters. The DC of the checks and saves could be 15.\n",
    "- Step 4: Run the encounter, following the **rules** for **combat**, **movement**, **damage**, **healing**, **conditions**, **ailments**, and **environmental effects**. Use the **plot mechanics** and the **action mechanics** to narrate the events and outcomes of the encounter. For example, the Gatemaster could describe how the Jaffa patrol spots the team and pursues them on their gliders, how the team tries to evade them or fight back using their vehicles and weapons, how the ally reveals his treachery and tries to sabotage the team, and how the rebels come to the rescue and help the team reach the Stargate. The Gatemaster could also use the **dice** to determine the success or failure of the actions, the damage or healing of the combatants and vehicles, and the effects of the conditions and ailments. The Gatemaster could also use the **tension die** to add some randomness or drama to the encounter, such as a glider crashing, a motorcycle breaking down, or a rebel being captured. The Gatemaster could also use the **mission points** to reward the player characters for achieving their objective, overcoming the complication, surviving the twist, and reaching the resolution."

    "Sure, here's a step-by-step guide on how to run a mounted or ship combat based on the Stargate RPG core rulebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Determine Initiative**: At the start of a combat encounter, each participant makes an Initiative check. The GM makes one roll for a group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Establish Positions**: The GM decides where all the characters and NPCs are located. Given the nature of the combat, this might be a simple narrative description, or you might use a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Take Turns**: Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Begin the Next Round**: After everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 3 until the fighting stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "For mounted or ship combat, there are a few additional considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Movement**: Depending on the mount or ship, the speed can be significantly higher than on foot. Make sure to adjust the movement speed accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attacks**: Some mounts or ships might have their own attacks, or they might provide equipment for the characters to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Damage and Hit Points**: If a mount or ship is attacked, it might have its own pool of hit points. If it's reduced to 0 hit points, it could be destroyed or incapacitated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Riding Checks**: If the characters are riding mounts, they might need to make checks to control their mount in difficult conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cover**: Ships or large mounts might provide cover for the characters, making them harder to hit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Boarding**: In ship combat, there might be rules for boarding enemy ships. This can turn a ship combat into a more traditional on-foot combat.\n",
