# StargateTTRPG
This is a tabletop RPG manager and generator made specifically for use with the [Stargate RPG](https://stargatetherpg.com/).
It's meant for use with the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note taking app. It will generate planets based on the rules set out in the Stargate Core Rule Book, giving the area surrounding the gate on that planet a biome, a name, a number of geological features, a number of governments and types of those governments, religion types, and can even generate new alien species based on the rules of the game.
The encounters tab is designed to generate combat encounters based on party composition and track all different types of encounters.
